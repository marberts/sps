documentation is unclear or if certain functions don't have enough documentation.

## Suggestions for improvement

Open an issue if you have any suggestions for improvements (e.g., feature requests).

## Seeking support

Open an issue (or send me an email) if you're stuck and not able to find an
answer in the documentation. (It may be a bug or problem with the documentation.)

1. Fork the repository on github and make a new branch in your forked copy;

2. Follow the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/);

3. Use `roxygen2` for documentation;
