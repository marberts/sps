# sps: Sequential Poisson Sampling

Sequential Poisson sampling is a method for drawing probability proportional to size samples with a given number of units, and is commonly used for price-index surveys. This package gives functions to draw a stratified sequential Poisson sample according to the method in Ohlsson (1998), and generate bootstrap replicate weights according to the method in Beaumont and Patak (2012).
