# sps: Sequential Poisson Sampling

Sequential Poisson sampling is a variation of Poisson sampling for
drawing probability-proportional-to-size samples with a given number of
units, and is commonly used for price-index surveys. This package gives
functions to draw stratified sequential Poisson samples according to the
method by Ohlsson (1998, ISSN:0282-423X), as well as other order sample
designs by Rosén (1997,
[doi:10.1016/S0378-3758(96)00186-3](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0378-3758%2896%2900186-3)
), and generate approximate bootstrap replicate weights according to the
generalized bootstrap method by Beaumont and Patak (2012,
[doi:10.1111/j.1751-5823.2011.00166.x](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1751-5823.2011.00166.x)
).
